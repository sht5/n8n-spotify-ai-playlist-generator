## Component Development

This project includes Storybook for isolated component development:

- **SongCard**: Individual song display with metadata and interactions
- **VinylLoader**: Animated loading indicator with customizable text
- **ChatInterface**: Conversational UI for playlist generation
- **PlaylistPreview**: Main playlist display with drag-and-drop functionality
- **PlaylistControls**: Form controls for playlist metadata and creation

Browse components at http://localhost:6006 when running Storybook.

## Architecture

The frontend integrates with an n8n workflow backend through three main webhook endpoints:

- `/generate-suggestions` - Initial AI playlist generation from user prompt
- `/refine-suggestions` - Iterative refinement of existing suggestions  
- `/create-playlist` - Final Spotify playlist creation with approved songs

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed architectural documentation.
